   9:40 Clojure on SCIs (Opening Keynote)
   Malcolm Sparks
   40 minAbstract

   In the past few years I've been developing a secure durable programmable system, called Site. The language of this system is SCI, the
   small-clojure-interpreter that powers babashka. In this talk I'll explain some of the notable features and benefits of this system, for
   example, how state updates are made by submitting database transactions (to XTDB) written as SCI code. I'll explain why I chose SCI and
   some of the reasons SCI makes a perfect scripting language to embed in a JVM-based application, providing some tips along the way to
   others who want to try using SCI in this way.
